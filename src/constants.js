            Toastmasters is a way of life. Learning how to communicate better lets us live more at ease.<br/> 
            NITK Toastmasters Club is my home and a fine one at that. I am glad I have the club meetings to look forward to every week. <br/> 
            Calling is one of the best Toastmaster clubs in the world would not be an exaggeration. From the time of the club's inception, 
            every Executive Committee has strived hard for excellence and propelled the club and it's wonderful members to great lengths. <br/> 
            Our members have a lot of raw talent that if nurtured in the correct manner, will enable them to mature into accomplished orators. 
            A safe space with a friendly environment is provided to everyone which enables them to fulfil the purpose of joining the club: 
            becoming better communicators and leaders. I am blessed to have a team of able leaders who always stand resolutely by my side. <br/> 
            I hope to set an example by making this year a benchmark term and serving as an inspiration, the way I was inspired by the legacy of the club.
            The past year saw us winning numerous accolades and saw a lot of firsts. With the zeal displayed by our members, 
            I am sure we are ready to achieve even more and soar above the clouds.

            The concept of Toastmasters came from Ralph C Smedley, where he saw that the men lacked the skills to speak, plan and lead teams effectively.
            He wanted to come up with a solution to this and suggested the idea of having a club where people could work on these skills in a social 
            environment as all these skills were needed in society.
            This vision is the seed that was planted as the core mission of Toastmasters International and continues to be to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
            TMI is a non-profit educational organisation that helps everyone to build on their speaking and leadership skills through positive
            learning experiences. 
            Additionally, a consequence of this is that members are closer to realising their maximum potential and achieving it through these experiences.
            It moulds people to their best version.
        </p>
        <p>
            All members pay a small fee of 45$ every 6 months to renew their membership. 
            The costs are evidently micro scale compared to the benefits offered as TMI shows no signs of slowing down with more than 16,200 
            clubs situated across 145 countries and approximately 364,000 members.

            Dear Toastmasters of NITK,
            Rarely does a leader of a voluntary organisation have the good fortune to lead a group of persons who are as committed to growth and 
            leadership as toastmasters. District 121 is endowed with many members of sterling qualities and clubs that are torchbearers of 
            innovation. As I consider your club's many achievements and the consistent levels of motivation that you display, 
            I feel very proud to claim you as our own.
            The very fact that you're willing to open a website is a sign of your willingness to be there for the long haul. 
            The district pins its hopes on clubs like yours and this endeavour will hopefully open up new avenues of activities for you. 
            As your Club Growth Director I wish you all the best. Continue to shine on!

            The unbridled passion of the members and sheer commitment is unrivalled in college Toastmasters club.

            It is amazing to see the club embrace the online meeting format, go all out during this pandemic situation, and do so much for the members.
            We already see a lot of club members who have stepped out of the club, participated in several events hosted by Division F and our District. 
            We also have seen several members serve the District by being a part of the extended teams of the PQD and PR. 
            I am confident that, in the coming days, NITK Toastmasters Club will continue to serve as a role-model club for the other college clubs around.

            In the words of Oprah Winfrey,
            “The key to realizing a dream is to focus not on success but on significance, 
            and then even the small steps and little victories along your path will take on greater meaning.”
        </p>
        <p>
            A group of motivated, young adults determined to acquire new skills, polish existing ones and better themselves make NITK Toastmasters club
            the wonder it is, setting the bar higher for themselves and the club every meeting. 
            The past year has been no different as we’ve only been adding feathers of achievement to our cap.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right in the beginning of this club year, 
            we were joined by nine new enthusiastic friends and were recognised by Toastmasters International with The Smedley Award. 
            Our members shared their Toastmaster’s journey with friends,
            who then chose to join us on this journey, and we were given the Talk Up Toastmasters Award.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under the ongoing pandemic, our members are still motivated to grow and learn every day. 
            We have already renewed 20+ memberships, becoming the superstar club of our district. Having maintained the club standards, 
            conducting regular meetings and not letting the pandemic dampen our spirits, we were awarded the Covid Golden Gavel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Toastmasters International follows a points system, The Distinguished Club Program (DCP) Points, 
            that rewards a club with points on achieving certain sets of goals. 
            Our club has received a ribbon from The District Committee for achieving 5 DCP points within the first 6/7 months of the year.
            We also have achieved 10 DCP points within the month of February this year. 
            Clubs with 9 or more DCP points are awarded The President's Distinguished Club by Toastmasters International. 
            Our club, with its ever enthusiastic members, has been winning The President's Distinguished Club award for three consecutive years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having received support from people around us whenever it was required, we found the need to give back to the society in our own little ways.
            We were awarded the YLP citation as recognition for our efforts in trying to mould the children around us into better speakers and leaders. 
            The enthusiasm and fun that we have was captured in a newsletter and this effort won us the 3rd place for the Best Newsletter Award in The District Toastmasters Annual Convention.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a club filled with dedication, this is only the beginning and have many more to come.
            We are eagerly waiting for you to join us on our journey of achieving as we help you discover skills that shall make you the master communicator and leader.
